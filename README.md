### What I learned
I learnt a lot while working through this project. I would love to show you the codes I'm proud of but I can't really decide which code specifically, because I'm proud of all these codes. I had to make Researches on how to use flexbox and grid very well, was also having issues with other CSS properties but thanks to some blog post I would provide links to those post below.  

### Continued development
I would really love to learn more on CSS grid and flexbox, I only understand the basics and I would love to understand more so I can confidently use them on layout on other webpages I would work on.


### Useful resources

- [link to css flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me understand flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [link to css layout article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flex. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
